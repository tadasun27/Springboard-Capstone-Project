Load Libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(googleVis)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(verification)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(caTools)
library(ROCR)
library(e1071)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
